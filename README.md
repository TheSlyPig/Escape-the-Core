## Features
✓ The player controls a small circle and can orbit the center circle by pressing the left and right keys.

✓ Shapes close in on the player, but always leave one open space the player can slip through.

✓ The player dies and must restart upon collision with any of the shapes.

✓ Music plays in the background, and the center circle pulses with the beat.

✓ The music loops when the song ends, and when starting or restarting the level it starts at one of several possible starting points to 
avoid too much repetition.

✓ Sound effects, including an encouraging voice-over every 10 seconds.

✓ The colors of the lines are constantly changing.

✓ The entire canvas rotates semi-randomly.

✓ The player wins if they survive for 60 seconds, but may keep playing until they die, though the game gets noticeably harder after 60 seconds.

✓ Takes advantage of local storage to remember the player's progress and best scores.

✓ Multiple levels of increasing difficulty, that are unlocked by beating the previous level.

✓. Google Firebase integration for global high score tracking. The player can input their name to be saved alongside the high score.
